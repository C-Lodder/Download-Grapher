Download-Grapher
================

A Joomla Component to view downloads with graphical feature. It allows you to track weekly download counts and total download counts of anything you like! It uses the jQuery Visualize plugin (with a few tweaks). So all bugs in it are going to be due to my changes!!

Primarily designed for use on my own site I decided it might be useful for anyone else if they wished to adapt to their own site and so uploaded it to github. I hope that you find this useful if you choose to use it!

Please feel free to post about any bugs etc. And I'll try and fix them ASAP
